//! An asynchronous HTTP/2 API over the sans-I/O core.
//!
//! Enabled by the default `http` feature. Disabling it returns the crate to a pure
//! state machine with exactly one dependency and no I/O of any kind.
//!
//! Everything in this subtree is confined to it: nothing outside `src/http/` acquires an
//! async facility, and a structural test enforces that. It contains no `unsafe` of its
//! own. The sans-I/O core is unchanged and remains usable on its own.
//!
//! # Shape
//!
//! A client connection is two objects. [`handshake`] hands back a cloneable handle for
//! making requests and a driver future that moves octets. A server connection is one:
//! [`serve`] takes a handler and hands back the driver. Nothing happens until the driver
//! is polled, and where it is polled is entirely the caller's business — this crate spawns
//! nothing and takes no executor, spawner or timer.
//!
//! Both ends share one driver. What differs between them is small and named: where work
//! comes from, what a completed header block means, and when there is nothing left. Reads,
//! writes, flow control, buffer reuse and the park predicate are the same code at both
//! ends rather than the same idea written twice.
//!
//! Server handlers run concurrently without being spawned: they are futures the driver
//! holds, each woken by a waker naming its own stream. A handler that *blocks* rather than
//! returning `Pending` stalls its whole connection, since there is no other thread for the
//! connection to be on — see [`server`] for what to do about that.
//!
//! # What must be `Send`
//!
//! The transport need not be, deliberately: the completion-based runtimes this layer
//! exists to serve are thread-per-core and build their I/O on `Rc`. Auto traits propagate
//! instead, so a driver over a `Send` transport is `Send` without anything declaring it.
//!
//! Outgoing bodies are the exception. They are stored inside the session, which may be
//! moved between threads, so they inherit the sans-I/O core's `Send + 'static` bound.
