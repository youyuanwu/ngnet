//! What a handle and the driver say to each other.
//!
//! # Why the connections live in the driver and nothing else touches them
//!
//! A [`Conn`](crate::Conn) is `Send` but deliberately not `Sync`, and every method that
//! drives it takes `&mut self`. Exactly one thing may hold it, and that thing must be
//! whatever is polling the socket — so the driver owns every connection outright and the
//! handles a caller holds never see one.
//!
//! Sharing them behind a lock would buy nothing. The driver would still have to take that
//! lock for every datagram it processed, and no other task could usefully hold it, because
//! anything a caller wants to do to a connection has to be sequenced against the packets
//! arriving for it anyway.
//!
//! So this module is a mailbox rather than shared ownership. Handles push commands and read
//! results; the driver drains commands, does the work, and writes results back.
//!
//! # Why the handlers can be `'static`
//!
//! `Conn<'h, S>` borrows its handlers for `'h`, so a driver holding a collection of
//! connections needs `Conn<'static, S>` — a handler that borrowed a driver field would make
//! the driver self-referential. Every handler installed here therefore captures an
//! [`Arc<ConnectionShared>`] and nothing else, which is owned rather than borrowed and
//! satisfies the `Send` bound the core requires for a sound `Conn`.
