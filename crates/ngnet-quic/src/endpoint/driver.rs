//! The loop that makes everything happen.
//!
//! # What one pass does, and why in this order
//!
//! 1. **Drain commands** from the handles, bounded, so a caller's writes reach ngtcp2
//!    before this pass produces packets rather than after.
//! 2. **Read datagrams** from the socket, bounded by
//!    [`Config::datagrams_per_pass`](super::Config), routing each to its connection.
//! 3. **Service expired timers**, since a datagram may have made a timer fire and a timer
//!    may produce something to send.
//! 4. **Write**, draining every connection that has anything until it says it has nothing.
//! 5. **Rearm** from the earliest [`Conn::expiry`](crate::Conn::expiry) across all
//!    connections.
//!
//! Steps 2 and 4 are bounded and step 5 is not skippable. Between them those two facts are
//! the whole liveness argument: a connection cannot monopolise a pass, and no pass ends
//! without a timer armed for whatever wants attention next.
//!
//! # The two mistakes this shape exists to avoid
//!
//! **Not rearming after a write pass.** ngtcp2 paces its sending, and reports the pacing
//! deadline through the same `expiry()` as everything else
//! (`crates/ngnet-quic-sys/vendor/ngtcp2/lib/ngtcp2_conn.c:11387`). A driver that only rearms after reading will
//! send one datagram and then sleep until the peer says something — which for a bulk
//! transfer is never, and which looks like a hang rather than a slow connection.
//!
//! **Calling `update_pkt_tx_time` here.** It is tempting, since this is where the pacing is
//! respected. The core's write paths already call it (`src/packet.rs:168-175`,
//! `src/stream_io.rs:177-184`), and calling it again would push the deadline forward twice
//! per packet, halving the send rate for no visible reason.
