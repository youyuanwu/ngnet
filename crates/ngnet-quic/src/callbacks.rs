//! The bridge from ngtcp2's C callbacks back to Rust state.
//!
//! ngtcp2 accepts a `user_data` pointer at construction and hands it to every callback. It
//! offers no way to change it afterwards. But the state a callback needs — the
//! application's handlers, the connection's own bookkeeping — is borrowed only for the
//! duration of one call into the library, and lives at an address that may move between
//! calls. Registering it directly is therefore not possible.
//!
//! The indirection is the same one `ngnet-h3` uses. What ngtcp2 receives is a stable,
//! boxed [`BridgeSlot`] that lives as long as the connection. Before each call that can
//! fire callbacks, a [`Bridge`] holding the live borrows is installed into the slot by a
//! [`BridgeGuard`], and the guard clears it on drop — **including while unwinding**, so a
//! stray later callback cannot follow a pointer into a dead frame.
//!
//! # What this does not have to handle
//!
//! Nested calls. The slot holds exactly one pointer, so an installed bridge would be
//! overwritten by a second. That is sound here because ngtcp2 forbids re-entering it:
//! `read_pkt`, `writev_stream` and `write_connection_close` all state they "must not be
//! called from inside the callback functions" (`ngtcp2.h:4256`, `:5318`, `:6665`).
//!
//! Note the scope of that rule, because it is narrower than it first reads: it covers the
//! **packet-processing** entry points, not the whole API. The crypto callbacks in
//! [`crate::tls_bridge`] are *required* to call back into the connection — installing keys
//! and submitting handshake data from inside `client_initial` is how a handshake starts at
//! all (`ngtcp2.h:2641-2648`). Those callbacks deliberately do not use this slot; they reach
//! their state through the connection's TLS handle instead, so no second bridge is ever
//! installed and the one-pointer argument above still holds.
//!
//! # The one callback this cannot serve
//!
//! `rand` receives neither the connection nor `user_data`, and fires during construction
//! before `user_data` is stored. It reaches its entropy source through
//! `settings.rand_ctx.native_handle` instead — see [`crate::rand`].
//!
//! # Why the slot carries the entropy source as well
//!
//! `get_path_challenge_data` *does* receive `user_data`, but what it needs is unpredictable
//! bytes rather than the application's handlers. It reads them from the slot, which lives as
//! long as the connection, so path validation cannot depend on whether a bridge happened to be
//! installed. A connection has deliberately **one** source of randomness: two could diverge,
//! and only one of them would be the one an application configured.
