//! Packets in, packets out, and the timers that drive both.
//!
//! This is where the sans-I/O loop closes. A caller receives a datagram, hands it to
//! [`Conn::read_pkt`], asks [`Conn::write_pkt`] for datagrams to send until it says there
//! are none, and asks [`Conn::expiry`] when to come back. Nothing here touches a socket or
//! a clock.
//!
//! # Two results that are easy to get wrong
//!
//! **A zero-length write is not "nothing to do".** `ngtcp2_conn_writev_stream` returning `0`
//! means "buffer too small or congestion limited" (`ngtcp2.h:5240-5243`), and the documented
//! response is to keep reading and wait for the congestion window to open. Treating it as
//! "the send loop is finished" is the classic way to build a connection that stalls under
//! load and works perfectly in tests. [`WriteOutcome`] gives the two cases different names.
//!
//! **An idle timeout is not an error to answer.** `NGTCP2_ERR_IDLE_CLOSE` means the
//! connection should be dropped *without* writing a CONNECTION_CLOSE
//! (`ngtcp2.h:4709-4713`). Routing it through the generic close path would send a packet to
//! a peer that has already gone.
