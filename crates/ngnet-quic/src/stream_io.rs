//! Streams, flow control, and closing the connection.
//!
//! A QUIC connection carries data on streams. This module is the half of the API a caller
//! spends most of its time in: opening streams, writing to them, granting the peer credit,
//! and eventually shutting the whole thing down.
//!
//! # Credit is not automatic
//!
//! Two obligations here are easy to miss because omitting them produces no error, only a
//! peer that goes quiet.
//!
//! Flow-control credit is consumed as the peer sends, and is only replenished when the
//! application says so. And **stream-count limits are never raised by the library**: "The
//! library does not increase maximum stream limit automatically"
//! (`ngtcp2.h:5586-5594`). An application that accepts streams but never calls
//! [`Conn::extend_max_streams_bidi`] will let the peer open exactly as many as the initial
//! transport parameters allowed, and then no more, forever.
