//! Holding sent stream data until the peer acknowledges it.
//!
//! ngtcp2 does not copy the stream data it accepts. `ngtcp2_conn_writev_stream` serialises
//! some of it into the packet being built and **keeps the caller's pointer** so it can
//! retransmit if the packet is lost:
//!
//! > The caller must keep the portion of data covered by `|*pdatalen|` bytes in tact until
//! > `ngtcp2_callbacks.acked_stream_data_offset` indicates that they are acknowledged by a
//! > remote endpoint or the stream is closed.
//! >
//! > — `deps/ngtcp2/lib/includes/ngtcp2/ngtcp2.h:5244-5248`
//!
//! A safe API therefore cannot pass the caller's borrow through and return. The caller is
//! free to drop that buffer the instant the call ends, and any later retransmission would
//! read freed memory — a use-after-free reachable from entirely safe code.
//!
//! So the connection keeps its own copy of every byte ngtcp2 accepted, and hands ngtcp2 a
//! pointer into *that*. The copy is released when the acknowledgement arrives, or when the
//! stream ends.
//!
//! # Why chunks rather than one buffer per stream
//!
//! A `Vec` would reallocate as it grew, moving bytes ngtcp2 still holds pointers to. Each
//! accepted write therefore becomes its own `Box<[u8]>`, whose address is fixed for as long
//! as it lives, and chunks are dropped whole once fully acknowledged.
//!
//! # The cost, stated plainly
//!
//! One copy of every byte sent, held until acknowledged. `ngnet-h3` avoids the equivalent
//! copy by making its callers hand over ownership; this crate takes the copy instead,
//! because a `&[u8]` that the caller may reuse immediately is the more ordinary signature
//! and the safety of the API should not depend on reading a paragraph of documentation.
//! See `docs/quic/pending-work.md`.
