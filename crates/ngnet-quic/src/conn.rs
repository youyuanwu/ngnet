//! The QUIC connection.
//!
//! One `Conn` wraps one `ngtcp2_conn`, plus everything ngtcp2 retains a pointer to and
//! everything the callbacks need to reach. It is the type that turns a pile of C objects
//! with interlocking lifetime rules into something that can be moved, used and dropped like
//! any other Rust value.
//!
//! # What must outlive the connection, and what need not
//!
//! ngtcp2 **copies** its callbacks struct, its settings, its transport parameters, the path
//! addresses and the connection IDs. Those may be temporaries.
//!
//! It **retains pointers** to exactly four things: the `ngtcp2_mem` allocator
//! (`ngtcp2_conn.h:645`, dereferenced during `ngtcp2_conn_del` at `ngtcp2_conn.c:1827`), the
//! `user_data` pointer, `settings.rand_ctx.native_handle`, and `path.user_data` (unused
//! here). Those live in boxes this type owns.
//!
//! Once the TLS handle is installed there is a fifth, and it points at the session this type
//! owns. ngtcp2 treats it as opaque — it stores the pointer and hands it back — so the crypto
//! callbacks recover the session from it and nothing points the other way. That used to be a
//! cycle, with the TLS library holding a reference back to the connection; removing it is most
//! of what the safe TLS seam bought.

// The read/write entry points that use `with_bridge`, `raw` and `path_mut` arrive with the
// packet paths. The connection is built and dropped by the tests below regardless.
