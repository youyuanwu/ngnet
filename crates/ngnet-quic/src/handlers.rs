//! Events a connection reports to its owner.
//!
//! ngtcp2 delivers everything through C callbacks. Rather than exposing forty-seven of
//! them, this crate groups the ones an application actually acts on into a handler struct
//! built through [`Handlers`], following the shape `ngnet-h3` uses.
//!
//! Handlers run **inside** a call into ngtcp2, with the connection mutably borrowed. They
//! therefore cannot call back into the connection — and three ngtcp2 entry points
//! (`read_pkt`, `writev_stream`, `write_connection_close`) explicitly forbid it anyway
//! (`ngtcp2.h:4256`, `:5318`, `:6665`). Anything a handler wants to *do* should be recorded
//! and acted on after the call returns.
//!
//! That restriction is about *these* handlers rather than about callbacks in general. The
//! crypto callbacks in [`crate::tls_bridge`] run in the same position and must do the
//! opposite: ngtcp2 requires them to install keys and submit handshake data on the very
//! connection that invoked them. The difference is which entry points are involved, not
//! whether a callback is running.
//!
//! A handler must not panic: unwinding into a C stack frame aborts the process.
