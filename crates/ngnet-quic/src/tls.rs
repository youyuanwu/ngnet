//! The TLS backend seam.
//!
//! QUIC and TLS are inseparable: the transport cannot send a packet before the handshake has
//! produced keys, and the handshake's own messages travel inside QUIC packets. ngtcp2 does not
//! implement TLS. It expects the application to supply a TLS stack, and ships *crypto helper*
//! libraries that bridge to a specific one.
//!
//! This module is the seam that keeps the choice open, and it is implementable in ordinary
//! safe Rust. [`Backend`] describes a configured TLS stack, [`Session`] one connection's
//! handshake, and [`Handshaking`] the connection a session is lent for the length of a call.
//! [`crate::tls_ossl`] implements them over OpenSSL and is enabled by default.
//!
//! # What a backend cannot do, and why that matters
//!
//! It cannot name ngtcp2, hold a raw pointer, or reach the connection except through the four
//! operations of [`Handshaking`]. Every call into ngtcp2 the handshake requires is made by
//! [`crate::tls_bridge`], from what a backend reports or asks for. So the hazards that used to
//! belong to every backend author — which callbacks to install, what a native handle means,
//! when a key may be released, what may be called re-entrantly — are solved once, here, and
//! are covered by tests that fail if they are undone.
//!
//! The seam this replaced was two `unsafe` traits. A backend had to hand ngtcp2 an untyped
//! pointer whose correct value was not the one an experienced OpenSSL user would reach for,
//! and fill in a callback table by hand. Both mistakes compiled cleanly and corrupted memory
//! at run time.
//!
//! # Why this is a trait at all, rather than the OpenSSL backend directly
//!
//! Each crypto helper compiles **its own copy** of ngtcp2's shared crypto code, with
//! backend-specific implementations behind identically-named symbols — `ngtcp2_crypto_ctx_tls`
//! exists separately in `ossl.c`, `wolfssl.c` and `gnutls.c`. And those symbols do not always
//! exist: `ngnet-quic-sys` includes the crypto headers only when a backend feature is on
//! (`wrapper.h:10-18`), so with `--no-default-features` there is no `ngtcp2_crypto_*` symbol in
//! the bindings at all. The seam is what lets the crate build with no TLS stack, exposing the
//! interface and nothing behind it.
//!
//! # Where the remaining difficulty is
//!
//! Not in the safety, which the compiler now carries, but in the *ordering*. Some of what a
//! session does has to take effect before its call returns, and some does not; the split is
//! not arbitrary and is explained on [`Handshaking`]. Getting it wrong produces a handshake
//! that succeeds locally and is rejected by the peer, which is the most expensive failure in
//! this design to diagnose.

///
/// 1. A server's own transport parameters name the version it settled on, and the QUIC library
///    fills that in only while decoding the *peer's* parameters. Encoded before that, the field
///    is zero, which the peer rejects as malformed.
/// 2. They also carry the connection identifier the server is using, which the library fills in
///    only while installing the handshake write key. Encoded before that, the parameter is
///    absent, and the peer rejects the set as incomplete.
/// 3. Both must land before the TLS stack writes the message carrying them, which it does
///    without returning from the call that delivered the peer's.
///
/// There is therefore no moment *between* those steps at which the crate is in control. These
/// operations have to take effect while the TLS stack is still on the stack, so a session
/// performs them rather than reporting them.
