//! A TLS backend written entirely in safe Rust, carrying two real QUIC connections.
//!
//! This is the claim the whole seam exists to support, made checkable. The module forbids
//! unsafe code outright — not `deny`, which an allowance can silence, but `forbid`, which
//! nothing inside can override — and it depends on nothing but this crate and `std`. Being an
//! integration test, it can reach only the public API, so it structurally cannot touch the raw
//! bindings even if it wanted to.
//!
//! # Why a backend and not a mock
//!
//! A stand-in that implements the traits and completes no handshake would prove only that the
//! signatures are inhabitable. What matters is whether the seam is *expressive enough* to
//! carry a real connection: whether a backend can get keys installed at the moments ngtcp2
//! needs them, exchange transport parameters when both sides' are knowable, and drive a
//! connection to the point of moving application data. So the two connections below are real
//! `Conn`s, exchanging real packets that this backend really protects.
//!
//! It also acts as a **server**, which is not incidental. A server is the side whose transport
//! parameters cannot be produced up front, and it is where an earlier design of this seam
//! failed — silently, and only against another implementation. A backend that could only be a
//! client would not have exercised the part that was wrong.
//!
//! # This scheme is not cryptography
//!
//! It is an exclusive-or against a keystream, with a checksum for a tag. It is trivially
//! breakable by design: making it strong would mean reimplementing TLS, which proves nothing
//! extra about the seam and would obscure the parts that matter. Nothing here is exported, and
//! it is unusable outside this file.
//!
//! What it does have to be is *correct* in the ways ngtcp2 depends on: authenticated, so a
//! forged packet is rejected rather than accepted as garbage; invertible in place, because the
//! seam protects one buffer; and agreed between the two sides, because otherwise the
//! connection would fail for reasons that had nothing to do with the seam.
